# Random Quote Generator
My first ever JavaScript project! It's a pretty straight forward app. When the "Show Another Quote" button is clicked,
a random quote is pulled from an array and displayed in the DOM.

## App Features
* Get a random quote from the quotes array in ```scripts/quotes.js``` and insert it in to the DOM
* Change the page's background to a random rgb color when a random quote is generated
* After 30 seconds, the quote and background color will automatically refresh. The interval is cleared, then restarted, when the button is clicked

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
